    This XML script file is used to control the behaviour of the enemy classes in the game.
    Each enemy class is represented in a XML tag below (eg <swarmer>)
    Each of these tags contains a keyword, this keyword is then used to determine which Pathfinding AI will be used
    
    The only recognised keywords are:
    
    ShortestPathFirst
    AvoidTurretDamage
    AvoidPlayerDamage
    
    If the keyword is not recognised, the default value (ShortestPathFirst) will be used.

  <swarmer>ShortestPathFirst</swarmer>
  <gunner>AvoidTurretDamage</gunner>
  <sneaker>AvoidPlayerDamage</sneaker>
  <heavy>ShortestPathFirst</heavy>
