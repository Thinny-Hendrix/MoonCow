<!--
    This XML script file is used to control the behaviour of the enemy classes in the game.
    Each enemy class is represented in a XML tag below (eg <swarmer>)
    Each of these tags contains a keyword, this keyword is then used to determine which Pathfinding AI will be used
    
    The only recognised keywords are:
    
    ShortestPathFirst
    AvoidTurretDamage
    AvoidPlayerDamage
    
    Bool for each enemy class for the following conditions:
    Do they chase the player
    Do they attack the player if in range of weapon
    Do they follow pathfinding
    Do they attack the core
    Do they have a ranged attack
    Do they have a melee attack
    
    Also add the sentry turret in as an entity in the settings
    
    If the keyword is not recognised, the default value (ShortestPathFirst) will be used.
-->
<behaviour>
  <swarmer>ShortestPathFirst</swarmer>
  <gunner>AvoidTurretDamage</gunner>
  <sneaker>AvoidPlayerDamage</sneaker>
  <heavy>ShortestPathFirst</heavy>
